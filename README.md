# Quiz Maker 9000

At this point in the project, this is more like a quiz generator than a quiz maker.
The only questions that are generated are those of place value and rounding problems.
Ultimately, I would like to be able to generate math problems all the way from rounding and place values, up to
trigonometric identities and the Binomial Theorem.

If you would like to contribute, there are plenty of bugs that have yet to be found.
You are encouraged to submit an issue. I'll take a look at it during my earliest convenience.
